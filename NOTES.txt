Notes:
	
	- before running the analisys make a Warm up of the machine 5/10 iterations
	- explain the dependent and independent varibles
	- the independent varible are for e.g: type size content different vesrion of java and IDE
	- try to compute using the media and the median then analize which is better
	- create some graphs maybe
